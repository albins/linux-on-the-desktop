# linux-on-the-desktop

This repository tracks a highly personal list of things I'd need "Linux" to support in order for Linux On The Desktop to be acceptable, by which I mean "roughly equivalent to the experience of using a six year old mac".

## Definitions

As far as I am concerned, the "operating system" is not the kernel. I do not interact with the kernel. The operating system is everything that runs from when I start the machine to when I interact with it. The "operating system" is the application development kit, the window manager, the terminal emulator, the email client, the desktop environment, etc. It is "the computer", as far as I am concerned.

Also note that I do not care about cost or hardware setup. If the system requires a solid latinum laptop with a price of the GDP of the US, I would still consider the requirements met. I want to know what is possible, what is being worked on, and how far away we are.

You can substitute whatever kernel gets there first for "linux". And no, "GNU" is not the userland. In all probability, Gnome, KDE, etc is the userland. It's not like I care who made `ls`.
